# WLED-Preset-remote
I needed a remote control solution for a multi-ESP WLED setup to activate presets across all instances. 
With the assistance of ChatGPT, I developed a script that runs on a separate ESP32, allowing me to trigger presets on predefined IPs using HTTP commands. 

While it may not be the most elegant solution, it gets the job done and could be useful for others facing a similar challenge.

Just copy the code in the Arduino IDE, change the SSID, PW and target IPÂ´s and flash it onto an ESP32.
