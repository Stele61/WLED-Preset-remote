# WLED-Preset-remote
I´ve needed a remote for a multi-esp WLED setup to trigger presets on all of the WLED-instances.
So I´ve created (with the help of chatgpt^^) a script which can run on a seperate ESP32 with buttons attached, and triggeres presets on predefined IP´s via HTTP command.

It shure is not the most elegant way of doing it, but it works and might help somebody.
